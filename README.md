# civ4_polynesians_and_hebrews
A little mod adding Polynesian and Hebrew civilizations to Civilization 4 (with the Warlords expansion)

Polynesia:
 * Unique Unit - Outrigger Canoe, a galley that can cross oceans
 * Unique Building - Tiki, a monument that reduces administrative costs
 * Leader: Kamehameha -- Expansive and Protective
  
Hebrews:
 * Unique Unit - Desert Nomad, a settler which can fight as well as a scout (and better in desert)
 * Unique Building - Talmudic Academy, a University which can be build as soon as you have Philosophy
 * Leader: Deborah -- Spiritual and Charismatic

I attempted to make city names in roughly (speculative) historical order, rather than Civ's usual ahistorical free-for-all approach. With Polynesia (unlike Civ 5) I tried to use actual cities and villages rather than a mishmash of cities, islands and entire nations. I started this mod years ago, before Civ 5 came out, but I do think Civ 5 missed highlighting one of the most striking things about Polynesian history, namely mind-blowing navigational prowess.

TODO: Add David (Aggressive and Charismatic?). 

Obviously, it would be rather nice if these civs, and particularly the leaders, had their own art. Using Pacal for Kamehameha and Boudica for Deborah is somewhat painful.
